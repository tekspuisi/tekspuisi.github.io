It's nothing fancy, just a Madeira folk guitar, all scuffed and scratched and finger printed. At the top is a bramble of copper wound strings, each one hooked through the eye of a silver tuning key. The strings are stretched down a long, slim neck, its frets tarnished, the wood worn by years of fingers pressing chords and picking notes. The body of Madeira is shaped like enormous yellow pear, one that was slightly damaged in shipping. The blond wood has been chipped and gouged to gray. Particularly where the pick guard fell of years ago. No, it's not a beautiful instrument, but it still lets me make music, and for that I will always treasure it.1.

bergenre musik Country dan aktris berkebangsaan Amerika Serikat. Swift paling
dikenal oleh media karena rambut curly emasnya dan mata kucingnya yang berwarna
biru. Taylor Swift gemar bernyanyi sejak kecil. Pada usia 3 tahun ia pernah
bernyanyi di hadapan sekumpulan wisatawan ketika bertamasya dengan kedua orang
tuanya. Ketika Swift di kelas empat, dia memenangkan kontes puisi nasional
dengan sebuah puisi sepanjang tiga halaman berjudul "Monster in My
Closet". Pada usia sepuluh., Seorang tukang reparasi komputer menunjukkan
dia cara bermain tiga chords pada gitar, yang kemudian memicu minatnya dalam
belajar instrumen. Setelah itu, Swift menulis lagu pertamanya, "Lucky

sebagai tempat untuk membantunya dengan rasa sakit dia dari ketidaknyamanannya
di sekolah. Dia adalah seorang korban bullying, dan sering menulis lagu untuk
mengungkapkan emosinya. Bagi Taylor, menulis dan menciptakan lagu merupakan
sarananya untuk menghilangkan stres.</a>

                                            The Power of Music in Our Life
Do you agree that music is important in our life? Yes I do, music has certain roles completing our day to day activities. Here are some reasons why music is heard everywhere and anywhere.
Firstly, music is a way to express feelings. When we fall in love, the kind of music we listen to will be all about love. When we’re sad, we will go for music that is melancholic in nature and immerse ourselves in the sadness. When we’re happy, we will choose songs with happy tunes too.
Songs can help to memorize the last experiences. A favorite song is a powerful documentary. People with Alzheimer or impaired brain would remember details about songs they were familiar with. For example, an elderly woman who couldn’t even remember her husband’s name would remember the details of her favorite song; when it was played, how it made her feel and things about the song that made it especially memorable for her.
Further, music can unite people for a cause and it can also change the world. A song with good lyrics and striking deep chords can stimulate the universal feeling of all people. We can see it in the case of the famous and legendary Michael Jackson’s ‘Heal the World’. It can arouse humanism of a lot of people in this world.
So what will the world be like without music? It will be lonely.

The society is hierarchicallystructured: the noblemen are called rengnge,the ordinary people to makaka, and the slavesto kaunan, birth determines which rank a personwill occupy.The distinctive features of the traditionalhouses (tongkonan) of the Toraja are the "buffalohorns", the roof design and the rich decorationon the walls. The buffalo is a symbol of status,courage, strength and fighting spiritDesigned as a representation on theuniverse, the tongkonan is constructed inthree parts: the upper world (the roof), theworld of humans (the middle of the building).and the underworld (the space under thefloor). The highly distinctive roofs constructedby the Toraja given rise to various ingeniousinterpretations.

                                            The Power of Music in Our Life
Do you agree that music is important in our life? Yes I do, music has certain roles completing our
day to day activities. Here are some reasons why music is heard everywhere and anywhere.
Firstly, music is a way to express feelings. When we fall in love, the kind of music we listen to
will be all about love. When we’re sad, we will go for music that is melancholic in nature and
immerse ourselves in the sadness. When we’re happy, we will choose songs with happy tunes
too.
Songs can help to memorize the last experiences. A favorite song is a powerful documentary.
People with Alzheimer or impaired brain would remember details about songs they were
familiar with. For example, an elderly woman who couldn’t even remember her husband’s name
would remember the details of her favorite song; when it was played, how it made her feel and
things about the song that made it especially memorable for her.
Further, music can unite people for a cause and it can also change the world. A song with good
lyrics and striking deep chords can stimulate the universal feeling of all people. We can see it in
the case of the famous and legendary Michael Jackson’s ‘Heal the World’. It can arouse humanism
of a lot of people in this world.
So what will the world be like without music? It will be lonely.

When we are happy, we would choose songs with happy tunes. Songs can help us memorize our old memories. A favorite song is a powerful documentary. People with Alzheimer would remember details about the songs they were familiar with. For example, an elderly woman who couldn’t even remember her husband name would remember the details of her favorite song: when it was played, how it made her feel and things about the song that made it especially memorable for her. Further, music can untie people for a cause and change the world. A song with good lyrics striking deep chords can stimulate the universal feeling of all people. We can see in the case of the famous and legendary Michael Jackson’s Heal the World. 1. People listen to music to …. a. remember Michael Jackson b. make their live important c. make them lonely d. enjoy their lives 2. Which of the following is true according to the text? a.

                            13. The Power of Music in Our Life
Do you agree that music is important in our life? Yes I do, music has certain roles completing our day to day activities. Here are some reasons why music is heard everywhere and anywhere.
Firstly, music is a way to express feelings. When we fall in love, the kind of music we listen to will be all about love. When we’re sad, we will go for music that is melancholic in nature and immerse ourselves in the sadness. When we’re happy, we will choose songs with happy tunes too.
Songs can help to memorize the last experiences. A favorite song is a powerful documentary. People with Alzheimer or impaired brain would remember details about songs they were familiar with. For example, an elderly woman who couldn’t even remember her husband’s name would remember the details of her favorite song; when it was played, how it made her feel and things about the song that made it especially memorable for her.
Further, music can unite people for a cause and it can also change the world. A song with good lyrics and striking deep chords can stimulate the universal feeling of all people. We can see it in the case of the famous and legendary Michael Jackson’s ‘Heal the World’. It can arouse humanism of a lot of people in this world.
So what will the world be like without music? It will be lonely.

The society is hierarchicallystructured: the noblemen are called rengnge,the ordinary people to makaka, and the slavesto kaunan, birth determines which rank a personwill occupy.The distinctive features of the traditionalhouses (tongkonan) of the Toraja are the "buffalohorns", the roof design and the rich decorationon the walls. The buffalo is a symbol of status,courage, strength and fighting spiritDesigned as a representation on theuniverse, the tongkonan is constructed inthree parts: the upper world (the roof), theworld of humans (the middle of the building).and the underworld (the space under thefloor). The highly distinctive roofs constructedby the Toraja given rise to various ingeniousinterpretations.

                            32. The Power of Music in Our Life
Do you agree that music is important in our life? Yes I do, music has certain roles completing our
day to day activities. Here are some reasons why music is heard everywhere and anywhere.
Firstly, music is a way to express feelings. When we fall in love, the kind of music we listen to
will be all about love. When we’re sad, we will go for music that is melancholic in nature and
immerse ourselves in the sadness. When we’re happy, we will choose songs with happy tunes
too.
Songs can help to memorize the last experiences. A favorite song is a powerful documentary.
People with Alzheimer or impaired brain would remember details about songs they were
familiar with. For example, an elderly woman who couldn’t even remember her husband’s name
would remember the details of her favorite song; when it was played, how it made her feel and
things about the song that made it especially memorable for her.
Further, music can unite people for a cause and it can also change the world. A song with good
lyrics and striking deep chords can stimulate the universal feeling of all people. We can see it in
the case of the famous and legendary Michael Jackson’s ‘Heal the World’. It can arouse humanism
of a lot of people in this world.
So what will the world be like without music? It will be lonely.

                            37. Choose the correct answer! Text for questions number 1 to 4:  Music is a way to express feelings. When we fall in love, the kind of music we listen to is all about love. When we are sad, we would go for music that is melancholic in nature and immerse ourselves in the sadness. When we are happy, we would choose songs with happy tunes. Songs can help us memorize our old memories. A favorite song is a powerful documentary. People with Alzheimer would remember details about the songs they were familiar with. For example, an elderly woman who couldn’t even remember her husband name would remember the details of her favorite song: when it was played, how it made her feel and things about the song that made it especially memorable for her. Further, music can untie people for a cause and change the world. A song with good lyrics striking deep chords can stimulate the universal feeling of all people. We can see in the case of the famous and legendary Michael Jackson’s Heal the World. 1. People listen to music to …. a. remember Michael Jackson b. make their live important c. make them lonely d. enjoy their lives 2. Which of the following is true according to the text? a.

Unremarkable b. Expendable c. Unforgettable d. Forgettable​</h2><br />
